## ⚙️ Tracks

### 1) General Track Projects
Any project revolving around prediction markets, be it a tool, integration, API, platform, infrastructure, etc., is welcome to submit. Refer Ideas tab to see some references.

**Recommended Prediction Market Themes:**
- Niche Prediction Markets
- Protocols / Infrastructure for Prediction Markets
- Social/GenZ
- Creative Thematic Apps

### 2) YZi Labs Preferred Projects

- **UMA's Optimistic Oracle (OO)**, which Polymarket depends on, is decentralized and transparent but slow (24–48h resolution). Opportunity: domain-specific or AI-assisted oracles for faster, contextual resolution. (CZ also mentions prediction market oracles as an opportunity area) - UMA OO can be vulnerable in low-liquidity, low-attention markets. Opportunity: build cross-protocol incentive layers to reward honest disputes, or autonomous dispute-bot networks to detect manipulation.

- **Prediction markets still feel like DeFi dApps**: complex wallets, bridging, and gas. Opportunity: leverage account abstraction and gasless UX to make prediction markets feel like normal apps.

- **Polymarket covers only well-defined, publicly verifiable events**. Opportunity: solve for subjective or multi-stage predictions

- **Liquidity is spread across many small markets**. Opportunity: aggregators, routing layers, or AMM-style liquidity pools to concentrate and reuse capital efficiently.

**Don't just predict the future. Build it.**
