## ⚙️ Tracks

### 1) General Track Projects

Any project revolving around prediction markets, be it a tool, integration, API, platform, infrastructure, etc., is welcome to submit. Refer Ideas tab to see some references.

#### Recommended Prediction Market Themes:

- 🎯 **Niche Prediction Markets**
- 🏗️ **Protocols / Infrastructure for Prediction Markets**
- 👥 **Social/GenZ**
- 🎨 **Creative Thematic Apps**

### 2) YZi Labs Preferred Projects

#### Oracle Improvements
- **UMA's Optimistic Oracle (OO)**, which Polymarket depends on, is decentralized and transparent but slow (24–48h resolution)
- **Opportunity:** domain-specific or AI-assisted oracles for faster, contextual resolution. (CZ also mentions prediction market oracles as an opportunity area)
- UMA OO can be vulnerable in low-liquidity, low-attention markets
- **Opportunity:** build cross-protocol incentive layers to reward honest disputes, or autonomous dispute-bot networks to detect manipulation

#### UX Enhancement
- Prediction markets still feel like DeFi dApps: complex wallets, bridging, and gas
- **Opportunity:** leverage account abstraction and gasless UX to make prediction markets feel like normal apps

#### Market Expansion
- Polymarket covers only well-defined, publicly verifiable events
- **Opportunity:** solve for subjective or multi-stage predictions

#### Liquidity Solutions
- Liquidity is spread across many small markets
- **Opportunity:** aggregators, routing layers, or AMM-style liquidity pools to concentrate and reuse capital efficiently

**Don't just predict the future. Build it.**
