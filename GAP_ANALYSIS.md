## Judging Criteria Deep Dive

### DoraHacks Evaluation Criteria

| Criteria | Weight | How to Maximize |
|----------|--------|-----------------|
| Technical Implementation | High | Clean code, working prototype, smart contracts deployed |
| Creativity/Innovation | High | Novel approach, unique IP (pm-AMM, AI dispute detection) |
| Design & Usability | Medium | Intuitive UI, mobile-first, gasless UX |
| Adoption & Market | Medium | Clear TAM, user acquisition strategy, traction |
| Overall Presentation | Medium | Demo video quality, documentation, pitch |

### BNB Chain Specific Criteria

| Criteria | Requirement | Action |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| Deployment | BSC/opBNB/Greenfield | Deploy contracts with 2+ successful transactions |
| Open Source | Required | Public GitHub repo with commit history |
| Novelty | Must prove | Document what's new vs existing solutions |
| Functionality | Must work | Demo core features, not just slides |
| Documentation | Critical | Tutorials, API docs, integration guides |

### Disqualification Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Lack of novelty proof | Document first pm-AMM implementation, AI dispute detection uniqueness |
| Unrealized functions | Build working MVP, not vaporware |
| Usability issues | Test with real users, gasless onboarding |
| Not deployed on BNB Chain | Deploy to BSC mainnet/testnet with transactions |
| Closed source | Public GitHub from day 1 |

## Quick Wins to Stand Out

### 1. Early Deployment
Deploy contracts to BNB testnet NOW, even if basic. Shows commitment and enables iteration.

### 2. Commit History
Start coding immediately. Daily commits look better than last-minute bulk uploads.

### 3. Community Engagement
- Join hackathon Telegram (required)
- Attend all workshops (bonus points)
- Get early user feedback

### 4. Sponsor Leverage
- Use Thirdweb for account abstraction (workshop sponsor)
- Use Azuro for betting infrastructure (workshop sponsor)
- Use APRO/RedStone for oracle data (BNB partners)

### 5. Open Source Excellence
- MIT license
- Clear README
- API documentation
- Example integrations
