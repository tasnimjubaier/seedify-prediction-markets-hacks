## User Demographics

### Geographic Distribution

**Pre-2025 (Polymarket)**:

### Behavioral Characteristics

Based on crypto trader research:

1. **Speculative nature**: Returns driven by retail speculation
2. **Social media influence**: Strong correlation with Twitter/X, Reddit sentiment
3. **Momentum trading**: Behavioral patterns follow market trends
4. **Information asymmetry**: "Amateur" investors interpret information differently

| Category | Polymarket | Kalshi | Trend |

## User Acquisition & Retention

## Wash Trading & Bot Activity

### Columbia University Study Findings (Nov 2025)

| Metric | Finding |
|--------|---------|
| Suspected wash trading | ~25% of total volume |
| Peak fake volume | 60% of weekly volume (Dec 2024) |
| Flagged wallets | 14% of 1.26M total |
| Most affected | Sports & election markets (>90% in some weeks) |

### Why Polymarket is Vulnerable
1. No identity verification (KYC)
2. No trading fees
3. USDC-only (easy to automate)
4. Airdrop speculation incentivizes volume

### Implications
- Actual user base may be smaller than reported
- Volume metrics potentially inflated
- "Wisdom of crowd" accuracy may be overstated

### Current Frustrations

3. **UX complexity**: Wallets, gas fees, bridging
4. **Limited markets**: Only well-defined, verifiable events
5. **Liquidity issues**: Wide spreads, slippage on large orders

### Desired Features

1. **Faster resolution**: Minutes, not hours/days
2. **Better UX**: Gasless, mobile-first, no wallet setup
3. **More markets**: Subjective events, niche topics
