**Build**: Oracle + liquidity infrastructure
**Advantage**: B2B revenue, all platforms need it
**Risk**: Longer sales cycle

### Option 2: Consumer Platform
**Target**: Compete with Polymarket, Opinion Labs
**Build**: Sports-focused prediction app
**Advantage**: Direct user acquisition
**Risk**: Need liquidity bootstrap

### Option 3: Hybrid
**Target**: Full stack on BNB Chain
**Build**: Oracle + platform
**Advantage**: Complete solution
**Risk**: More complex, more competition

### Recommended Approach

**Build Infrastructure First** (Oracle + Liquidity)
- Solves highest-value problems ($7M + $10M)
- YZi Labs priority alignment
- B2B revenue from all platforms
- Can add consumer layer later

**Differentiation**:
1. AI-powered dispute detection (unique)
2. First pm-AMM on BNB Chain (novel)
3. Sports-optimized resolution (demand)
4. Gasless integration (UX)

---

## Key Competitor Insights

### What Works
1. **Regulatory compliance** (Kalshi's advantage)
2. **Distribution partnerships** (Robinhood, X)
3. **Sports focus** (90% of volume)
4. **Mobile-first** (84% of bets)
5. **AI integration** (Grok partnership)

### What Fails
1. **Slow oracles** (24-48h too slow)
2. **Poor security** ($7M manipulation)
3. **UX friction** (wallets, gas)
4. **Thin liquidity** ($10M wasted)
5. **Wash trading** (25% fake volume)

### Unmet Needs
1. Fast, secure oracles
2. Efficient liquidity
3. Gasless transactions
4. BNB Chain native platform
5. Sports-specific infrastructure

---

## Conclusion

### Competitive Landscape Summary
- **Leaders**: Polymarket ($9B) & Kalshi ($5B)
- **Growing**: $8.5B monthly volume
- **Entering**: DraftKings, Coinbase, Gemini
- **BNB Chain**: Underserved (Opinion Labs launching)

### Highest Value-Delta Opportunities
1. **AI Dispute Detection Oracle** - Solves $7M problem
2. **pm-AMM Implementation** - Solves $10M problem
3. **Gasless Sports App** - Captures demand shift

### Strategic Recommendation
Focus on **infrastructure** (oracle + liquidity) for BNB Chain. This:
- Aligns with YZi Labs priorities
- Solves documented expensive problems
- Differentiates from consumer-focused Opinion Labs
- Provides B2B revenue opportunity
- Can bootstrap with hackathon support

Building the "picks and shovels" during a gold rush often yields better returns than mining directly.
