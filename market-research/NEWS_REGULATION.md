## State Regulation

### New York Assembly Bill A9251 (Nov 7, 2025)

**Sponsor**: Assemblyman Clyde Vanel (D)

**Key Provisions**:
- Frames prediction markets as speculative futures platforms
- **Prohibits** contracts based on:
  - Catastrophic events
  - Political events
  - Security markets
  - Deaths
  - Specific athletic events
- **Permits**: Tournament outcomes, combined athletic events
- **Requires**: Exclusion of insider information holders

**Impact**: Creates state-level restrictions even as federal clarity emerges

### State vs Federal Conflict

- New York gaming commission issued cease-and-desist to Kalshi
- Identified specific event contracts as unlawful
- Kalshi continuing operations while fighting in court
- If courts favor Kalshi's preemption argument → nationwide operation without state licenses

### Polymarket Oracle Manipulation (March 2025)

**What Happened**:
- Rogue actor submitted false data to UMA oracle
- Submission went unchallenged
- Finalized incorrectly
- $7M paid to wrong party

**Root Causes**:
- Low participation in dispute process
- Centralization of UMA voting power
- 24-48h resolution window

**Response**:
- UMA tightened dispute processes

## Regulatory Implications for Builders

### Compliance Considerations

#### What's Permitted (US)
- Sports predictions (with proper licensing)
- Tournament outcomes
- Combined athletic events
- Economic/financial events
- Crypto-related events

#### What's Restricted (Varies by State)
- Political events (NY prohibits)
- Catastrophic events
- Individual deaths
- Security market predictions

### Building for Compliance

1. **Know your jurisdiction**: Federal vs state rules
2. **Consider DCM licensing**: Required for US operation
3. **Exclude prohibited categories**: Political events risky
4. **Implement KYC**: Reduces wash trading risk
5. **Design for transparency**: On-chain verification

### Opportunities in Regulation

1. **Sports markets**: Clearly permitted, high volume
2. **Economic predictions**: Opinion Labs model
3. **Crypto predictions**: Gray area, less scrutiny
4. **International markets**: Different rules
